# roalflab


The purpose of this github repository is to promote information sharing and project replicability both within the Roalf Lab and with our collaborators.

We aim to have user-friendly SOPs for the following: 
- QSIPrep
- fMRIPrep
- pyGluCEST
- HDBET

In addition, we are hoping to add documentation for all ongoing projects. We're planning to follow the Satterthwaite Lab's documentation approach: 
  https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/Contributing/ProjectTemplate/
  https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/LabHome/ReproSystem/
